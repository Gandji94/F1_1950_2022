# F1_1950_2022

The following tableau report showcases data from 1950-2022 of formula one (F1).
The data is divided into two dashboards.
These dashboards will contain information about:
- Which driver has the most world championships?
- Which constructor has won the most constructor championships?
- Where are the Grand Prix tracks, and how many times did a Grand Prix take place?
- Overview of which Grand Prix are one by a driver and how many times
- The youngest and oldest
  - Race starter
  - Race winner
- Number of seasons in the F1 by driver
- Win ratio of the F1 driver
- Number of drivers by nation
- World Championship points development for each driver

The data set for the report was provided by the Kaggle
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020?select=driver_standings.csv

The CSV files have been uploaded to the SQLite database. In the database, queries have been generated to create suitable files for the tableau reports/dashboards.

This report will help F1 newbies get up to speed by knowing the key stats. Well-established F1 fans will also enjoy this report by refreshing their knowledge or using it to test their F1 knowledge.

**Note

Since the data set for pole positions was not fully completed (data was missing), I have decided not to include the pole position data.

Around 2010 we can notice a vast points increase. This is due to the new points-awarding system that was introduced in 2010.

Regarding the 2022 data, the season is still in progress (3 more races to go (current date 27.10.2022)), therefore the 2022 season is not complete yet. The latest eentry in the data set for the 2022 season was the race in Hungary.
