The data set for the report was provided by the Kaggle

This report will help F1 newbies get up to speed by knowing the key stats. Well-established F1 fans will also enjoy this report by refreshing their knowledge or using it to test their F1 knowledge.

**Note
Since the data set for pole positions was not fully completed (data was missing), I have decided not to include the pole position data.

Around 2010 we can notice a vast points increase. This is due to the new points-awarding system that was introduced in 2010
